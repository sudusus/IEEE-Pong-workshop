# IEEE-Pong-workshop

This repo was created for an PSUHBG IEEE workshop.
This game requires two players. Player one used the "w" and "s" keys. Player 2 uses "up_arrow" and "down_arrow".

Required dependencies are pyautogui and pygame.
Before attempting to run this python file, open the terminal and type "pip list".
This command will list all of the libraries you have installed in that interpreters path.
If you find you are lacking a library you can use pip to install it.
Pip will download the module from... somewhere, idk it's magic.


On macOS terminal

To install pygame type "python3 -m pip install pygame".
To install pyautogui type "python3 -m pip install pyautogui".


On windows command line

To install pygame type "python -m pip install pygame".
To install pyautogui type "python -m pip install pyautogui".


On linux terminal

Let's be honest, if you use linux you don't need this README.


Should additional errors be encountered, searching for them on the internet is recommended.
