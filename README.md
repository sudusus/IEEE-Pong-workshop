# IEEE-Pong-workshop

This repo was created for an PSUHBG IEEE workshop
Required dependencies are pyautogui and pygame

Before attempting to run this python file, open the terminal and type "pip list".
This command will list all of the libraries you have installed in that interpreters path.
If you find you are lacking a library you can use pip to install it.
Pip will download the module from... somewhere, idk it's magic.

To install pygame type "python3 -m pip install pygame"
To install pyautogui type "python3 -m pip install pyautogui"

Should additional errors be thrown, searching for them on the internet is recommended.
